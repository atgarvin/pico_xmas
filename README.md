# pico_xmas

What Is This?
==============================
This is pico_xmas, a simple way to control strips of lights in a musical way.  Great for making a cool Christmas light show.

This repository contains simple examples that should be provide a good starting point.
Code is written with Micropython, intended for a raspberry pi pico.


Getting Started
==============================
To get started, all you really need is to
1. Download an example file.
2. Make any necessary changes to the top of the file to set pins, BPM, and "music commands".
3. Upload to a raspberry pi.


Further Setup Help
==============================
If you need more help getting started, check out this guide: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/1

Continue with the guide to install Thonny, which will be used for editing the file and uploading it to the pico.
(Look at "Install Thonny on other operating systems" and ignore "Thonny on Raspberry Pi")

Once Thonny is installed, continue with the guide and Add the MicroPython firmware.

Continue with the guide to learn more.  You can skip parts 7 and 8 (led brightness/analogue input).
Part 9 (power your pico) explains how to get the file onto the pico.



Misc Tips
==============================
It is probably helpful to run the script from Thonny before uploading it to the pico to check for errors.

If you are frustrated by errors in Thonny, it might be worth using something like PyCharm for editing the file, as it can help prevent/correct errors.
